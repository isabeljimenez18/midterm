		<h1><u><i>History</i></u></h1>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h2><u>Name</u></h2>
		
		<p>From its founding in 1919 by progressive New York educators, and for most of its history, the university was known as The New School for Social Research. Between 1997 and 2005 it was known as New School University. The university and each of its colleges were renamed in 2005.</p>

		<p>The New School established the University in Exile and the École libre des hautes études in 1933 as a graduate division to serve as an academic haven for scholars escaping from Nazi Germany among other adversarial regimes in Europe. In 1934, the University in Exile was chartered by New York State and its name was changed to the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science. In 2005, it adopted what had initially been the name of the whole institution, the New School for Social Research, while the larger institution was renamed The New School.</p>
		
		<h2><u>Founding</u></h2>
		
		<p>The New School for Social Research was founded by a group of university professors and intellectuals in 1919 as a modern, progressive, free school where adult students could "seek an unbiased understanding of the existing order, its genesis, growth and present working". Founders included economist and literary scholar Alvin Johnson, historian Charles A. Beard, economists Thorstein Veblen and James Harvey Robinson, and philosophers Horace M. Kallen and John Dewey. Several founders were former professors at Columbia University.</p>

		<p>In October 1917, after Columbia University imposed a loyalty oath to the United States upon the entire faculty and student body, it fired several professors. Charles A. Beard, Professor of Political Science, resigned his professorship at Columbia in protest. His colleague James Harvey Robinson resigned in 1919 to join the faculty at the New School.</p>

		<p>The New School plan was to offer the rigorousness of postgraduate education without degree matriculation or degree prerequisites. It was theoretically open to anyone, as the adult division today called Schools of Public Engagement remains. The first classes at the New School took the form of lectures followed by discussions, for larger groups, or as smaller conferences, for "those equipped for specific research". In the first semester, 100 courses, mostly in economics and politics, were offered by an ad hoc faculty that included Thomas Sewall Adams, Charles A. Beard, Horace M. Kallen, Harold Laski, Wesley Clair Mitchell, Thorstein Veblen, James Harvey Robinson, Graham Wallas, Charles B. Davenport, Elsie Clews Parsons, and Roscoe Pound. John Cage later pioneered the subject of Experimental Composition at the school.</p>

		<h2><u>Traditions</u></h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Each August, community residents, the university, and local businesses stop traffic on the 12th street block for one afternoon. A massive block party is then thrown, celebrating the return of New School students to Greenwich Village. Another block party is held in the spring, usually during one of the first warm weeks of the semester.</li>
			<li>The Fusion Fashion Show is one of The New School's, and New York City's, biggest industry events. Each year, first and second-year undergraduates from Parsons compete directly with the fashion program's fiercest rival—Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT)—in the show, vying for awards and the title of best overall school.</li>
			<li>The New School annually hosts the Parsons Fashion Benefit, which is consistently attended by celebrities and industry moguls. It showcases the work of the current graduating class and raises money to fund scholarships for the fashion design program</li>
			<li>Every April, the university celebrates V-Day for two weeks. Originally started by the student feminist organization Moxie (which has since disbanded), "V-Day at The New School" has been adopted by the community and become a major part of campus life. In conjunction with V-Day, the university also recognizes each April as Sexual Assault and Prevention Awareness Month. During this time, T-shirts painted with feminist art and statements against sexual and domestic violence are hung on a clothesline in the windows of every major academic building. This is done as part of the Clothesline Project, and seeks to engage the public with New School's activist community.</li>
			<li>New School's annual Take Back the Night March is also held during April. In this event, students lead the university community through the streets of Greenwich Village in a public demonstration against sexual violence.</li>

		<h2><u>Rebranding</u></h2>

		<h4><i>2005</i></h4>

		<p>In June 2005, the university was rebranded with a new logo and all schools were officially renamed to include "The New School" within their formal names.</p>

		<p>Some faculty, students, and alumni expressed concern over the rebranding of the university, and especially the dramatic redesign of the logo from a six-sided shield against a green background to a spray-painted graffiti mark reading simply, in capital letters, "THE NEW SCHOOL" with, in smaller letters beneath, "A UNIVERSITY". They claimed that the university's new identity campaign, while maintaining a slick urban edge, did little to suggest academic rigor or collegiate legacy.</p>

		<h4><i>2015</i></h4>

		<p>In 2015 the New School rebranded using elements designed by Paula Scher of Pentagram using a bespoke font called "Neue".</p>

		<p>In addition to the new logo, the school announced that it was combining Mannes, Jazz, and Drama into a College of Performing Arts in fall 2015, relocating most of the performing arts to Arnhold Hall at 55 West 13th St., where the School of Jazz had occupied two floors since 1986.</p>
